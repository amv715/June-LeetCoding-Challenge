/*
Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        
        int low = 0;
        int high = citations.size()-1;
        int hIndx = 0; 
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high-low)/2;
            
            if (citations[mid] >= (high-mid+1)+hIndx) {
                hIndx += (high-mid+1);
                high = mid-1;
            } else {
                low = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return hIndx;
    }
};
